# wazmrt

A Zig-based WebAssembly runtime aimed at being **blazingly fast** and the
**smallest possible binary** — and itself compilable to wasm, so it can be
embedded into any language via the `universalWasmLoader-*` loaders
(jvm, c, go, dotnet, dart, rs, py, v, zig, js).

Built by studying the best and fastest parts of the leading wasm runtimes and
adopting — with full attribution — only what earns its place. See
[`third_party/LICENSES.md`](third_party/LICENSES.md) for the evaluation and
compliance process, and for the ledger of any reused code.

This dual license is the WebAssembly/Rust ecosystem standard. It lets consumers
in any language pick whichever license fits their project, and it is compatible
with incorporating code from every reference runtime (all permissive: MIT, ISC,
Apache-2.0, and Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception). Third-party code we incorporate
stays under its own license and is tracked in
[`third_party/LICENSES.md`](third_party/LICENSES.md).
